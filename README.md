# This is a repository in which I am going to learn some git.

Git is a version control system.
It is a bit tricky at first but after a while becomes second nature.

Here are some initial commands:

1. 'git init'
2. 'git status'
3. 'git add file'
4. 'git commit'
5. 'git log'
6. 'git diff'
7. 'git branch'
8. 'git checkout'
9. 'git reset'
10. 'git merge'
